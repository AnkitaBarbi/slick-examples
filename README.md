Starting with Slick 2.1, the separate example projects like this one have been
replaced by Activator templates. Please see the "Getting Started" chapter in the
[Slick documentation](http://slick.typesafe.com/docs/) for details.

You can still find older versions of this project for older Slick releases
under the respective tags.
